Refactor the HTML and CSS in `src/App.js` to use components.

* Your solution should have over 10 components
* Replace all hard-coded data with the static data below
* Deploy your app to a public URL

## Data

```js
const wines = [{
  id: 1,
  imageUrl: '/red-wine.jpg',
  isNew: true,
  label: 'Wine',
  isFinished: true,
}, {

  imageUrl: '/red-wine.jpg',
  label: 'Wine',
  isFinished: true,
}, {
  id: 3,
  imageUrl: '/red-wine.jpg',
  label: 'Wine',
